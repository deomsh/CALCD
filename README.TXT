Known bugs:
CALCD.G4B is not working with 'debug off'/ 'debug 0'. So set minimal 'debug 1' on the grub4dos' command-line before use. Will be fixed in next release.

History:

v0.2.1
Bugfixes (especially in Cubic Root)
Cubic Root (CBRT) gives 18 decimals now (but not rounded)
Function CRT renamed to CBRT
Function FAC renamed to FACT
Simpler handling of multiple calculations on command-line:
- Continue/ restart calculation with \\ only needed after COUNT
- Functions INV, SQRT and M cannot be used before there argument anymore
- Function CBRT must now be used after argument
- Single number on command-line allowed (including MR, R and 0!-20!)
Help has been rewritten, about 250 examples
New funtions:
HEX: convert number/ result to hexa-decimal number (rounddown!)
THSEP: adds thousands-comma-separator to last number/ result (input with thousands-comma's allowed too)
SQ: Square of number
CB: Cubic of number
MIN: lowest number on command-line/ (md)
MAX: highest number on command-line/ (md)
COUNTIF: count of numbers on command-line/ (md) 'satisfying' if-condition
New switch: /Q for quiet operation
Display of 'smallhelp' after (syntax-)error
