History:

v2.0
Bugfixes (especially in Cubic Root)
Cubic Root (CBRT) gives 18 decimals now (but not rounded)
Function CRT renamed to CBRT
Function FAC renamed to FACT
Simpler handling of multiple calculations on command-line:
- Continue/ restart calculation with \\ only needed after COUNT
- Functions INV, SQRT and M cannot be used before there argument anymore
- Function CBRT must now be used after argument
- Single number on command-line allowed (including MR, R and 0!-20!)
Help has been rewritten, about 240 examples
New funtions:
HEX: convert number/ result to hexa-decimal number
THSEP: adds thousands-comma-separator to last number/ result (input with thousands-comma's allowed too)
SQ: Square of number
CB: Cubic of number
New switch: /Q for quiet operation
